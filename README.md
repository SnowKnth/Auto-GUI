# You Only Look at Screens: Multimodal Chain-of-Action Agents

*"In every systematic inquiry (methodos) where there are first principles, or causes, or elements, knowledge and science result from acquiring knowledge of these; for we think we know something just in case we acquire knowledge of the primary causes, the primary first principles, all the way to the elements."*

Auto-UI is a multimodal solution that directly interacts with the interface, bypassing the need for environment parsing or reliance on application-dependent APIs. To improve the agent's action prediction capability, we propose a novel chain-of-action technique, where a chain of action is a series of intermediate previous action histories and future action plans that lead to action prediction.

The code and model will be released soon. Stay tuned!
